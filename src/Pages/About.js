            My name is Moses Enyinnaya. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer and love making things that might possibly work using
            JavaScript. I currently work as a Senior Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. I was also a Developer
            Advocate for 2 years at Cloudinary before joining Microsoft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before becoming an advocate, I loved working as a consultant. I consulted as a Software Developer, Developer
            Advocate, Technical Writer and Community Champion for startups including Scotch.io, Auth0, Pusher,
            Cloudinary, Progress, deepstreamHub, Logrocket, Dialog Engineers, Manifold, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love working with the developer communities to build an ecosystem. With forces from colleagues and friends
            we built communities like forLoop Africa, Angular Nigeria, Concatenate Conference, Me.io, Frontstack.io and
            a lot more. I am responsible for expanding the forLoop Africa communities across new African countries and
            ecosystems while trying my best to sustain the existing ones.
